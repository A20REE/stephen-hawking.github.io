  <b>English theoretical physicist and cosmologist</b>

  <p style="color: rgb(29, 186, 133);">
    <b>Stephen Hawking was a renowned theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author</b>, best known for his
    groundbreaking
    work on <i><u>black holes and the nature of the universe</u></i>. Born on January 8, 1942<sub>s</sub>, in Oxford,
    England, he
    made
    significant contributions to science, particularly in the fields of general relativity and quantum mechanics. His
    most famous discovery, Hawking radiation, showed that black holes can emit radiation and eventually evaporate over
    time.

      <i>Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of physicians. In October 1959, at the age of 17</i>,<ins>he began his
        <b>university
          education at College, Oxford</b></ins>, where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. In October 1962,
      he<br>
      began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where, in March 1966, he obtained his PhD in applied
      mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology. In 1963, at age 21, Hawking
      was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease that gradually, over decades,
      paralysed him. After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device, initially
      through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.<br>

      Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with <u>Roger Penrose</u> on <b>gravitational singularity
        theorems in
        the framework of general relativity</b>, and <u style="color: rgb(254, 38, 38);">the theoretical prediction that
        black holes emit radiation,
        often called
        Hawking radiation</u>. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s, and following the
      publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics.
      Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity
      and quantum mechanics. Hawking was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum
      mechanics.[23][24] He also introduced the notion of a micro black hole <br>
      <br>
      Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in which he discussed his theories and
      cosmology in general.<b> <u>His book A Brief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a
          record-breaking 237 weeks</u></b>.<br> Hawking was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime member of the
      Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award
      in the United States. In 2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. He died
      in 2018 at the age of 76, having lived more than 50 years following his diagnosis of motor neurone disease.

    <b><strong>Family</strong></b>
    <p>
      Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 in Oxford to Frank and Isobel Eileen Hawking (née Walker).
      Hawking's mother was born into a family of doctors in Glasgow, Scotland. His wealthy paternal
      great-grandfather, from Yorkshire, over-extended himself buying farm land and then went bankrupt in the great
      agricultural depression during the early 20th century. His paternal great-grandmother saved the family from
      financial ruin by opening a school in their home.[31] Despite their families' financial constraints, both
      parents<br>
      attended the University of Oxford, where Frank read medicine and Isobel read Philosophy, Politics and
      Economics. <u style="color: #8f5424;">Isobel worked as a secretary for a medical research institute, and Frank was
        a medical
        researcher. Hawking had two younger sisters, Philippa and Mary, and an adopted brother, Edward Frank David
        (1955–2003)</u><br>
      <br>
      In 1950, when Hawking's father became head of the division of parasitology at the National Institute for Medical
      Research, the family moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire. <i style="color: rgb(254, 38, 38);">In St Albans, the
        family was considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric; meals were often spent with each person
        silently reading a book.</i> They lived a frugal existence in a large, cluttered, and poorly maintained house
      and travelled in a converted London taxicab. During one of Hawking's father's frequent absences working in Africa,
      the rest of the family spent four months in Mallorca visiting his mother's friend Beryl and her husband, the poet
      Robert Graves.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Hawking began his schooling at the <u style="color: rgb(79, 132, 224);">Byron House School</u> in <u style="color: rgb(79, 132, 224);">Highgate</u>, London. He later blamed its "progressive methods" for his failure to learn to read while at the school.[41][34] In St Albans, the eight-year-old Hawking attended St Albans High School for Girls for a few months. At that time, younger boys could attend one of the houses

        <li>
          <u>Hawking attended two private (i.e. fee-paying) schools, first Radlett School and from September 1952, St Albans School, Hertfordshire, after passing the eleven-plus a year early</u>.<b> The family placed a high value on education.Hawking's father wanted his son to attend Westminster School</b>, but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill on the day of the scholarship examination.           
        </li>
        <li>
          His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans.[45][46] <u>A positive consequence was that Hawking remained close to a group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats,[47] and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception</u>.[48] From 1958 on, with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components.          
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Although known at school as "Einstein", Hawking was not initially successful academically</b>.With time, <u style="color: rgb(79, 132, 224);">he began to show considerable aptitude for scientific subjects</u> and, <u style="color: rgb(79, 132, 224);">inspired by Tahta, decided to study mathematics at university</u>.Hawking's father advised him to study medicine, concerned that there were few jobs for mathematics graduates

    <p>
      Hawking began his university education at University College, Oxford,[27] in October 1959 at the age of 17.[58] For the first eighteen months, he was bored and lonely – he found the academic work "ridiculously easy". <u>His physics tutor, Robert Berman, later said, "It was only necessary for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it</u>.<br> A change occurred during his second and third years when, according to Berman, Hawking made more of an effort "to be one of the boys". He developed into a popular, lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science fiction.
    <br>
    <br>
      Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat club, the University College Boat Club, where he coxed a rowing crew.<u><b>The rowing coach at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats</b></u>.[61][63] Hawking estimated that he studied about 1,000 hours during his three years at Oxford. These unimpressive study habits made sitting his finals a challenge, and he decided to answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge.
